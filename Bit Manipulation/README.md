# Bit Manipulation

1. Decode XORed Array

- arr[i+1] = encoded[i] ^ arr[i]

2. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero

- Check whether no is even it yes divide it by 2
- else subtract it by 1
- untill it became 0

3. XOR Operation in an Array

- Calculate XOR of all index & return it

4. Hamming Distance

- XOR of both number
- Count no's of 1

5. 1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings

- Convert allowed & words into set to remove duplicacy
- Iterate words & find subtract of set 
- If its 0 then it's contain all character  

6. 2206. Divide Array Into Equal Pairs

- Store count in dict
- If any count is then return false 

7. 2220. Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number

- XOR of both number
- Count no's of 1
